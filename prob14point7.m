% write a function to receive a vector as an input argument and will then
% calculate and return the moving average of every two elements.

% x = {x1, x2, x3, ... xn}
% let's first create the function equation then a vector script to call the
% function in and perform the necessary equation

everytwo = [1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25]; % create a random vector
% now let's call our function to average every two values
average(everytwo) % call average of everytwo vector to display the ans
